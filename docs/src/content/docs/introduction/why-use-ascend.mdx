## The Challenge of Modern Experimentation

In today's fast-paced product development landscape, teams face significant challenges when trying to validate features and make data-driven decisions:

- **Complex infrastructure requirements** — Setting up an experimentation platform requires expertise in backend services, databases, caching layers, and SDK development
- **Vendor lock-in concerns** — Commercial solutions often come with steep pricing, limited customization, and data ownership issues
- **Fragmented mobile support** — Many solutions don't offer first-class support across Android, iOS, and React Native
- **Scalability limitations** — As experiment volume grows, performance becomes a bottleneck

**Ascend solves all of these problems.**

## Why Choose Ascend?

### 🆓 Truly Open Source

Ascend is built with ❤️ by the open-source community under the MIT License. This means:

- **No vendor lock-in** — You own your data and infrastructure
- **Full transparency** — Audit the code, understand exactly how experiments work
- **Community-driven** — Feature requests and contributions shape the roadmap
- **Cost-effective** — No per-seat licensing or usage-based pricing surprises

### 🚀 Production-Ready Performance

Built on battle-tested technologies, Ascend is engineered for scale:

| Component | Technology | Benefit |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Backend Framework | Vert.x 4.4.9 | Reactive, non-blocking I/O for high throughput |
| Database | PostgreSQL, Aerospike 6.2.0 | Reliable, partitioned storage for experiment data, Sub-millisecond variant assignments at scale  |
| Resilience | Resilience4j 2.2.0 | Circuit breakers, rate limiting, fault tolerance |

Ascend handles millions of assignment requests while maintaining consistent low-latency responses.

### 📱 Native Cross-Platform SDKs

Unlike solutions that treat mobile as an afterthought, Ascend provides first-class SDKs for all major platforms:

SDK features:
- **Type-safe APIs** — Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Automatic caching** — Graceful fallbacks when offline
- **Lifecycle integration** — Refresh experiments on app foreground
- **Minimal footprint** — Lightweight with no bloated dependencies
