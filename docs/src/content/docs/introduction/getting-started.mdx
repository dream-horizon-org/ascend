|----------|---------|
| **RAM** | 8 GB |
| **CPU** | 4 cores |
| **Disk Space** | 20 GB free |

## Quick Start: One-Command Installation

Get Ascend running on a docker in under 10 minutes:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/**/install.sh)
```

### What This Does

The installation script automatically:

1. ✅ Clones the Ascend repository
2. ✅ Checks and installs prerequisites (Docker etc.)
3. ✅ Sets up local Docker registry
4. ✅ Deploys Ascend with all components
5. ✅ Open localhost:3000 in browser


**Expected Duration**: 7-10 minutes (depending on internet speed and hardware)

### Installation Output

You'll see output similar to:

Now that Ascend is installed and configured, you can create your first experiment:

1. **Create an Environment**: Set up an isolated namespace for your services
2. **Define Your Service**: Create a service definition JSON
3. **Configure Provisioning**: Specify how components should be deployed
4. **Deploy**: Use the CLI to deploy your service
