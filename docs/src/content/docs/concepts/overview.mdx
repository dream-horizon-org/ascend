## What is Ascend?

Ascend is a comprehensive experimentation platform that consists of:

- **Backend Experiment Server (TestLab)**: A high-performance Java-based server built on Vert.x that manages experiments, handles variant assignments, and processes experiment data.
- **Backend Audience Server (Flockr)**: A high-performance Java-based server built on Vert.x that manages experiments, handles variant assignments, and processes experiment data.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage your experiment's lifecycle, audience's lifecycle , SDK's API Key.
- **Cross-Platform SDKs**: SDKs for Android, iOS, and React Native that seamlessly integrate with your applications.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Plugin-based architecture that allows extensibility and customization.

## Core Concepts

### Experiments

An **experiment** in Ascend is a controlled test where you compare different variants (versions) of a feature to determine which performs better. Each experiment includes:

- **Variants**: Different versions of your feature to test (e.g., control, treatment).
- **Allocation Strategy**: How users are assigned to variants (random(default), round-robin).
- **Target Rules**: Conditions that determine which users are eligible for the experiment.
- **Audience**: User segments for targeted experimentation. Create csv based audience.

---

### Allocation Strategies

Ascend supports multiple allocation strategies:

- **Stratified Allocation**: Users are assigned based on their audience segments.
- **Audience-Based Allocation**: Users are assigned based on audience membership with custom variant weights per audience.

### Experiment Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Experiment is being configured (Coming soon)
2. **Live**: Experiment is actively running
3. **Paused**: Experiment is temporarily stopped
4. **Concluded**: Experiment has finished and winning variant declared
5. **Terminated**: Experiment will no longer being served

## Core Capabilities

- **Feature Flags** :
Enable or disable specific product features for selected app attributes without deploying new code.

- **A/B Testing** :
Compare multiple variants of a feature to evaluate performance and identify the best-performing option.

- **Audience Targeting** :
Apply allocations based on user attributes and the audience segments the user belongs to, ensuring precise and personalized feature delivery.

- **Traffic Control** :
Regulate what percentage of incoming requests are assigned to experiments to manage system load or sample traffic intelligently.

- **Multivariate Testing** :
Test multiple variables at once to determine the optimal combination of feature variations and interactions.

## Quick Example

### 1. Server Side: Define an Experiment

```json
{
  "experiment_key": "button-color-test",
  "name": "Button Color Experiment",
  "status": "LIVE",
  "type": "A/B",
  "variants": [
   "control": {
         "display_name": "Control Group",
         "variables": [
           {
             "key": "button_color",
             "value": "blue",
             "data_type": "STRING"
           }
         ]
       },
       "variant1": {
         "display_name": "Test Variant 1",
         "variables": [
           {
             "key": "button_color",
             "value": "green",
             "data_type": "STRING"
           }
         ]
       }
  ],
  "variant_weights": {
    "control": 50,
    "treatment": 50
  },
  "distribution_strategy": "RANDOM",
  "exposure": 100
}
```

### 2. Client Side: Get Assignment

**Android:**
```kotlin
val experimentPlugin = Ascend.getPlugin<DRSPlugin>(Plugins.EXPERIMENTS)
val buttonColor = experimentPlugin.getExperimentService()
    .getStringFlag("button_color", "color")
```

**iOS:**
```swift
let experiments = try Ascend.getPlugin(AscendExperiments.self)
let buttonColor = experiments.getStringValue(for: "button_color", with: "color")
```

**React Native:**
```javascript
import { Ascend } from 'react-native-ascend-react-native-sdk';
const buttonColor = await Ascend.getStringValue('button_color', 'color');
```
